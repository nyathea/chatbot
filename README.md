# chatbot
Source code for my chatbot that uses openai's gpt-3.5-turbo api

it's not done yet. i still see alot that can be added or improved and im not really experienced in the slightest so the css and js might be a little messy.

## features:
- Chatting with gpt-3.5-turbo
- Generate images with dall-e 3 via "dallecreate <your prompt>"

## what's next?
- Options panel for changing system message for gpt, dall-e config, use own api key, and more
- UI improvements for desktop/mobile

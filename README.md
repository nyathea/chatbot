# chatbot
source code for my chatbot that uses openai's api.

this is just a little project im working on, styles and javascript may not be the best :3 

## features:
- Chatting with gpt-3.5-turbo
- Generate images by typing "dallecreate (your prompt)" in chat. this is a seperate mode from the regular chat so the ai has no knowledge of this.

## what's next?
- Options panel for changing system message, dall-e 3 config, use ur own api key, and more.
- Improve the AI memory.
- Possibly custom backgrounds?
- UI improvements for desktop/mobile
